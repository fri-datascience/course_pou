# Preface {-}

These are the exercises for the Principles of Uncertainty course of the Data Science Master's at University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science.

This document will be extended each week as the course progresses. At the end of each exercise session, we will post the solutions to the exercises worked in class and select exercises for homework. Students are also encouraged to solve the remaining exercises to further extend their knowledge.

Some exercises require the use of R. Those exercises (or parts of) are coloured <span style="color:blue">blue</span>. Students that are not familiar with R programming language should study \@ref(A1) to learn the basics. As the course progresses, we will cover more relevant uses of R for data science.
