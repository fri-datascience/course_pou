Solution. Let \\(g\\) be a function defined on \\(\\Omega\\). Let \\(X_i\\), \\(i = 1,...,n\\) be i.i.d. (multivariate) uniform random variables with bounds defined on \\(\\Omega\\). Let \\(Y_i\\) = \\(g(X_i)\\). Then it follows that \\(Y_i\\) are also i.i.d. random variables and their expected value is \\(E[g(X)] = \\int_{\\Omega} g(x) f_X(x) dx = \\frac{1}{V_{\\Omega}} \\int_{\\Omega} g(x) dx\\). By the strong law of large numbers, we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\xrightarrow{\\text{a.s.}} E[g(X)]. \\end{equation}\\] It follows that \\[\\begin{equation} V_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\xrightarrow{\\text{a.s.}} \\int_{\\Omega} g(x) dx. \\end{equation}\\] Exercise 2 Let \\(X\\) be a geometric random variable with probability 0.5 and support in positive integers. Let \\(Y = 2^X (-1)^X X^{-1}\\). Find the expected value of \\(Y\\) by using conditional convergence (this variable does not have an expected value in the conventional sense – the series is not absolutely convergent). R: Draw \\(10000\\) samples from a geometric distribution with probability 0.5 and support in positive integers to get \\(X\\). Then calculate \\(Y\\) and plot the means at each iteration (sample). Additionally, plot the expected value calculated in a. Try it with different seeds. What do you notice? Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} E[Y] &amp;= \\sum_{x=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^x (-1)^x}{x} 0.5^x \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{x=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^x}{x} \\\\ &amp;= - \\sum_{x=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{x+1}}{x} \\\\ &amp;= - \\ln(2) \\end{align*}\\] set.seed(3) x &lt;- rgeom(100000, prob = 0.5) + 1 y &lt;- 2^x * (-1)^x * x^{-1} y_means &lt;- cumsum(y) / seq_along(y) df &lt;- data.frame(x = 1:length(y_means), y = y_means) ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line() + geom_hline(yintercept = -log(2)) "]
