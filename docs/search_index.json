Show that \\(A\\) is not a sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Find the minimum number of elements to complete A to a sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Solution. \\(1^c = \\{2,3,...,10\\} \\notin A \\implies\\) \\(A\\) is not sigma algebra. First we need the complements of all elements, so we need to add sets \\(\\{2,3,...,10\\}\\) and \\(\\{1,3,4,...,10\\}\\). Next we need unions of all sets – we add the set \\(\\{1,2\\}\\). Again we need the complement of this set, so we add \\(\\{3,4,...,10\\}\\). So the minimum number of elements we need to add is 4. Exercise 1.2 (Diversity of sigma algebras) Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a set. Find the smallest sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Find the largest sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Solution. \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(2^{\\Omega}\\) Exercise 1.3 Find all sigma algebras for \\(\\Omega = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\). Solution. \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(A = 2^{\\Omega}\\) \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{0\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{0,2\\}, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{2\\}, \\{0,1\\}, \\Omega\\}\\) Exercise 1.4 (Difference between algebra and sigma algebra) Let \\(\\Omega = \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A} = \\{A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}: A \\text{ is finite or } A^c \\text{ is finite.} \\}\\). Show that \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is an algebra but not a sigma algebra. Solution. \\(\\emptyset\\) is finite so \\(\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). Let \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(B \\in \\mathcal{A}\\). If both are finite, then their union is also finite and therefore in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). Let at least one of them not be finite. Then their union is not finite. But \\((A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c\\). And since at least one is infinite, then its complement is finite and the intersection is too. So finite unions are in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). Let us look at numbers \\(2n\\). For any \\(n\\), \\(2n \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) as it is finite. But \\(\\bigcup_{k = 1}^{\\infty} 2n \\notin \\mathcal{A}\\). Exercise 1.5 (Intro to measure) Take the measurable space \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2\\}\\), \\(F = 2^{\\Omega}\\). Which of the following is a measure? Which is a probability measure? \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 5\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 6\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 11\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 1\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 0\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 1\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 1\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset)=0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\})=0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\})=\\infty\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\})=\\infty\\) Solution. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) &gt; 1\\). Neither due to countable additivity. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) = 0\\). Probability measure. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) &gt; 1\\). Exercise 1.6 Define a probability space that could be used to model the outcome of throwing two fair 6-sided dice. Solution. \\(\\Omega = \\{\\{i,j\\}, i = 1,...,6, j = 1,...,6\\}\\) \\(F = 2^{\\Omega}\\) \\(\\forall \\omega \\in \\Omega\\), \\(P(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\) 1.2 Properties of probability measures Exercise 1.7 A standard deck (52 cards) is distributed to two persons: 26 cards to each person. All partitions are equally likely. Find the probability that: The first person gets 4 Queens. The first person gets at least 2 Queens. R: Use simulation (sample) to check the above answers. Solution. \\(\\frac{\\binom{48}{22}}{\\binom{52}{26}}\\) 1 - \\(\\frac{\\binom{48}{26} + 4 \\times \\binom{48}{25}}{\\binom{52}{26}}\\) For the simulation, let us represent cards with numbers from 1 to 52, and let 1 through 4 represent Queens. set.seed(1) cards &lt;- 1:52 n &lt;- 10000 q4 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) q2 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) tmp &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) for (i in 1:n) { p1 &lt;- sample(1:52, 26) q4[i] &lt;- sum(1:4 %in% p1) == 4 q2[i] &lt;- sum(1:4 %in% p1) &gt;= 2 } sum(q4) / n ## [1] 0.0556 sum(q2) / n ## [1] 0.6995 Exercise 1.8 Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events with probabilities \\(P(A) = \\frac{2}{3}\\) and \\(P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Show that \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\leq P(A\\cap B) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\), and give examples to show that both extremes are possible. Find corresponding bounds for \\(P(A\\cup B)\\). R: Draw samples from the examples and show the probability bounds of \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) . Solution. - From the properties of probability we have \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\leq 1. \\end{equation}\\] From this follows \\[\\begin{align} P(A \\cap B) &amp;\\geq P(A) + P(B) - 1 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{6}, \\end{align}\\] which is the lower bound for the intersection. Conversely, we have \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\geq P(A). \\end{equation}\\] From this follows \\[\\begin{align} P(A \\cap B) &amp;\\leq P(B) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{2}, \\end{align}\\] which is the upper bound for the intersection. For an example take a fair die. To achieve the lower bound let \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{3,4,5,6\\}\\), then their intersection is \\(A \\cap B = \\{3\\}\\). To achieve the upper bound take \\(A = \\{1,2,3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{1,2,3,4\\}\\). For the bounds of the union we will use the results from the first part. Again from the properties of probability we have \\[\\begin{align} P(A \\cup B) &amp;= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\\\ &amp;\\geq P(A) + P(B) - \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align}\\] Conversely \\[\\begin{align} P(A \\cup B) &amp;= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\\\ &amp;\\leq P(A) + P(B) - \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ &amp;= 1. \\end{align}\\] Therefore \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\leq P(A \\cup B) \\leq 1\\). We use sample in R: set.seed(1) n &lt;- 10000 samps &lt;- sample(1:6, n, replace = TRUE) # lower bound lb &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) A &lt;- c(1,2,3) B &lt;- c(3,4,5,6) for (i in 1:n) { lb[i] &lt;- samps[i] %in% A &amp; samps[i] %in% B } sum(lb) / n ## [1] 0.1724 # upper bound ub &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) A &lt;- c(1,2,3) B &lt;- c(1,2,3,4) for (i in 1:n) { ub[i] &lt;- samps[i] %in% A &amp; samps[i] %in% B } sum(ub) / n ## [1] 0.5047 Exercise 1.9 A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. Show that, with probability one, a head turns up sooner or later. Show similarly that any given finite sequence of heads and tails occurs eventually with probability one. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P(\\text{no heads}) &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(\\text{no heads in first }n \\text{ tosses}) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} \\\\ &amp;= 0. \\end{align}\\] For the second part, let us fix the given sequence of heads and tails of length \\(k\\) as \\(s\\). A probability that this happens in \\(k\\) tosses is \\(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\). \\[\\begin{align} P(s \\text{ occurs}) &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(s \\text{ occurs in first } nk \\text{ tosses}) \\end{align}\\] The right part of the upper equation is greater than if \\(s\\) occurs either in the first \\(k\\) tosses, second \\(k\\) tosses,…, \\(n\\)-th \\(k\\) tosses. Therefore \\[\\begin{align} P(s \\text{ occurs}) &amp;\\geq \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(s \\text{ occurs in first } n \\text{ disjoint sequences of length } k) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (1 - P(s \\text{ does not occur in first } n \\text{ disjoint sequences})) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(s \\text{ does not occur in first } n \\text{ disjoint sequences}) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{2^k})^n \\\\ &amp;= 1. \\end{align}\\] Exercise 1.10 An Erdos-Renyi random graph \\(G(n,p)\\) is a model with \\(n\\) nodes, where each pair of nodes is connected with probability \\(p\\). Calculate the probability that there exists a node that is not connected to any other node in \\(G(4,0.6)\\). Show that the upper bound for the probability that there exist 2 nodes that are not connected to any other node for an arbitrary \\(G(n,p)\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{2} (1-p)^{2n - 3}\\). R: Estimate the probability from the first point using simulation. Solution. Let \\(A_i\\) be the event that the \\(i\\)-th node is not connected to any other node. Then our goal is to calculate \\(P(\\cup_{i=1}^n A_i)\\). Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we get \\[\\begin{align} P(\\cup_{i=1}^n A_i) &amp;= \\sum_i A_i - \\sum_{i&lt;j} P(A_i \\cap A_j) + \\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k} P(A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k) - P(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3 \\cap A_4) \\\\ &amp;=4 (1 - p)^3 - \\binom{4}{2} (1 - p)^5 + \\binom{4}{3} (1 - p)^6 - (1 - p)^6 \\\\ &amp;\\approx 0.21. \\end{align}\\] Let \\(A_{ij}\\) be the event that nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are not connected to any other node. We are interested in \\(P(\\cup_{i&lt;j}A_{ij})\\). By using Boole`s inequality, we get \\[\\begin{align} P(\\cup_{i&lt;j}A_{ij}) \\leq \\sum_{i&lt;j} P(A_{ij}). \\end{align}\\] What is the probability of \\(A_{ij}\\)? There need to be no connections to the \\(i\\)-th node to the remaining nodes (excluding \\(j\\)), the same for the \\(j\\)-th node, and there can be no connection between them. Therefore \\[\\begin{align} P(\\cup_{i&lt;j}A_{ij}) &amp;\\leq \\sum_{i&lt;j} (1 - p)^{2(n-2) + 1} \\\\ &amp;= \\binom{n}{2} (1 - p)^{2n - 3}. \\end{align}\\] set.seed(1) n_samp &lt;- 100000 n &lt;- 4 p &lt;- 0.6 conn_samp &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n_samp) for (i in 1:n_samp) { tmp_mat &lt;- matrix(data = 0, nrow = n, ncol = n) samp_conn &lt;- sample(c(0,1), choose(4,2), replace = TRUE, prob = c(1 - p, p)) tmp_mat[lower.tri(tmp_mat)] &lt;- samp_conn tmp_mat[upper.tri(tmp_mat)] &lt;- t(tmp_mat)[upper.tri(t(tmp_mat))] not_conn &lt;- apply(tmp_mat, 1, sum) if (any(not_conn == 0)) { conn_samp[i] &lt;- TRUE } else { conn_samp[i] &lt;- FALSE } } sum(conn_samp) / n_samp ## [1] 0.20565 1.3 Discrete probability spaces Exercise 1.11 Show that the standard measurable space on \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1,...,n\\}\\) equipped with binomial measure is a discrete probability space. Define another probability measure on this measurable space. Show that for \\(n=1\\) the binomial measure is the same as the Bernoulli measure. R: Draw 1000 samples from the binomial distribution \\(p=0.5\\), \\(n=20\\) (rbinom) and compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure. Solution. We need to show that the terms of \\(\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}\\) sum to 1. For that we use the binomial theorem \\(\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k} = (x + y)^n\\). So \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} = (p + 1 - p)^n = 1. \\end{equation}\\] \\(P(\\{k\\}) = \\frac{1}{n + 1}\\). When \\(n=1\\) then \\(k \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). Inserting \\(n=1\\) into the binomial measure, we get \\(\\binom{1}{k}p^k (1-p)^{1 - k}\\). Now \\(\\binom{1}{1} = \\binom{1}{0} = 1\\), so the measure is \\(p^k (1-p)^{1 - k}\\), which is the Bernoulli measure. set.seed(1) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) bin_samp &lt;- rbinom(n = 1000, size = 20, prob = 0.5) bin_samp &lt;- data.frame(x = bin_samp) %&gt;% count(x) %&gt;% mutate(n = n / 1000, type = &quot;empirical_frequencies&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(data.frame(x = 0:20, n = dbinom(0:20, size = 20, prob = 0.5), type = &quot;theoretical_measure&quot;)) bin_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = bin_samp, aes(x = x, y = n, fill = type)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) plot(bin_plot) Exercise 1.12 Show that the standard measurable space on \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1,...,\\infty\\}\\) equipped with geometric measure is a discrete probability space, equipped with Poisson measure is a discrete probability space. Define another probability measure on this measurable space. R: Draw 1000 samples from the Poisson distribution \\(\\lambda = 10\\) (rpois) and compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure. Solution. \\(\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} p(1 - p)^k = p \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} (1 - p)^k = p \\frac{1}{1 - 1 + p} = 1\\). We used the formula for geometric series. \\(\\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} = e^{-\\lambda} e^{\\lambda} = 1.\\) We used the Taylor expansion of the exponential function. Since we only have to define a probability measure, we could only assign probabilities that sum to one to a finite number of events in \\(\\Omega\\), and probability zero to the other infinite number of events. However to make this solution more educational, we will try to find a measure that assigns a non-zero probability to all events in \\(\\Omega\\). A good start for this would be to find a converging infinite series, as the probabilities will have to sum to one. One simple converging series is the geometric series \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^k\\) for \\(|p| &lt; 1\\). Let us choose an arbitrary \\(p = 0.5\\). Then \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p^k = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.5} = 2\\). To complete the measure, we have to normalize it, so it sums to one, therefore \\(P(\\{k\\}) = \\frac{0.5^k}{2}\\) is a probability measure on \\(\\Omega\\). We could make it even more difficult by making this measure dependent on some parameter \\(\\alpha\\), but this is out of the scope of this introductory chapter. set.seed(1) pois_samp &lt;- rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 10) pois_samp &lt;- data.frame(x = pois_samp) %&gt;% count(x) %&gt;% mutate(n = n / 1000, type = &quot;empirical_frequencies&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(data.frame(x = 0:25, n = dpois(0:25, lambda = 10), type = &quot;theoretical_measure&quot;)) pois_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = pois_samp, aes(x = x, y = n, fill = type)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) plot(pois_plot) Exercise 1.13 Define a probability measure on \\((\\Omega = \\mathbb{Z}, 2^{\\mathbb{Z}})\\).

Prove that the collection of all open subsets \\((a,b)\\) on \\((0,1]\\) is not a sigma algebra of \\((0,1]\\). Solution.

Then \\((0,1) \\in A\\). But \\((0,1)^c = 1 \\notin A\\). Exercise 2.2 Show that \\(\\mathcal{C} = \\sigma(\\mathcal{C})\\) if and only if \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is a sigma algebra. Solution. “\\(\\Rightarrow\\)” This follows from the definition of a generated sigma algebra. “\\(\\Leftarrow\\)” Let \\(\\mathcal{F} = \\cap_i F_i\\) be the intersection of all sigma algebras that contain \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). Then \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) = \\mathcal{F}\\). Additionally, \\(\\forall i: \\mathcal{C} \\in F_i\\). So each \\(F_i\\) can be written as \\(F_i = \\mathcal{C} \\cup D\\), where \\(D\\) are the rest of the elements in the sigma algebra. In other words, each sigma algebra in the collection contains at least \\(\\mathcal{C}\\), but can contain other elements. Now for some \\(j\\), \\(F_j = \\mathcal{C}\\) as \\(\\{F_i\\}\\) contains all sigma algebras that contain \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is such a sigma algebra. Since this is the smallest subset in the intersection it follows that \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) = \\mathcal{F} = \\mathcal{C}\\). Exercise 2.3 Let \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) be two collections of subsets on \\(\\Omega\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{D}\\). Prove that \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) \\subseteq \\sigma(\\mathcal{D})\\). Solution. \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{D})\\) is a sigma algebra that contains \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). It follows that \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{D})\\) is a sigma algebra that contains \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). Let us write \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) = \\cap_i F_i\\), where \\(\\{F_i\\}\\) is the collection of all sigma algebras that contain \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). Since \\(\\sigma(\\mathcal{D})\\) is such a sigma algebra, there exists an index \\(j\\), so that \\(F_j = \\sigma(\\mathcal{D})\\). Then we can write \\[\\begin{align} \\sigma(\\mathcal{C}) &amp;= (\\cap_{i \\neq j} F_i) \\cap \\sigma(\\mathcal{D}) \\\\ &amp;\\subseteq \\sigma(\\mathcal{D}). \\end{align}\\] Exercise 2.4 Prove that the following subsets of \\((0,1]\\) are Borel-measurable by finding their measure. Any countable set. The set of numbers in (0,1] whose decimal expansion does not contain 7. Solution. This follows directly from the fact that every countable set is a union of singletons, whose measure is 0. Let us first look at numbers which have a 7 as the first decimal numbers. Their measure is 0.1. Then we take all the numbers with a 7 as the second decimal number (excluding those who already have it as the first). These have the measure 0.01, and there are 9 of them, so their total measure is 0.09. We can continue to do so infinitely many times. At each \\(n\\), we have the measure of the intervals which is \\(10^n\\) and the number of those intervals is \\(9^{n-1}\\). Now \\[\\begin{align} \\lambda(A) &amp;= 1 - \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{9^n}{10^{n+1}} \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} (\\frac{9}{10})^n \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\frac{1}{10} \\frac{10}{1} \\\\ &amp;= 0. \\end{align}\\] Since we have shown that the measure of the set is \\(0\\), we have also shown that the set is measurable. Exercise 2.5 Let \\(\\Omega = [0,1]\\), and let \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\) consist of all countable subsets of \\(\\Omega\\), and all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) having a countable complement. Show that \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\) is a sigma algebra. Let us define \\(P(A)=0\\) if \\(A\\) is countable, and \\(P(A) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) has a countable complement. Is \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_3, P)\\) a legitimate probability space? Solution. The empty set is countable, therefore it is in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\). For any \\(A \\in \\mathcal{F}_3\\). If \\(A\\) is countable, then \\(A^c\\) has a countable complement and is in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\). If \\(A\\) is uncountable, then it has a countable complement \\(A^c\\) which is therefore also in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\). We are left with showing countable additivity. Let \\(\\{A_i\\}\\) be an arbitrary collection of sets in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\). We will look at two possibilities. First let all \\(A_i\\) be countable. A countable union of countable sets is countable, and therefore in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\). Second, let at least one \\(A_i\\) be uncountable. It follows that it has a countable complement. We can write \\[\\begin{equation} (\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i)^c = \\cap_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i^c. \\end{equation}\\] Since at least one \\(A_i^c\\) on the right side is countable, the whole intersection is countable, and therefore the union has a countable complement. It follows that the union is in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\). The tuple \\((\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_3)\\) is a measurable space. Therefore, we only need to check whether \\(P\\) is a probability measure. The measure of the empty set is zero as it is countable. We have to check for countable additivity. Let us look at three situations. Let \\(A_i\\) be disjoint sets. First, let all \\(A_i\\) be countable. \\[\\begin{equation} P(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}P( A_i)) = 0. \\end{equation}\\] Since the union is countable, the above equation holds. Second, let exactly one \\(A_i\\) be uncountable. W.L.O.G. let that be \\(A_1\\). Then \\[\\begin{equation} P(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty} A_i) = 1 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}P( A_i)) = 1. \\end{equation}\\] Since the union is uncountable, the above equation holds. Third, let at least two \\(A_i\\) be uncountable. We have to check whether it is possible for two uncountable sets in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\) to be disjoint. If that is possible, then their measures would sum to more than one and \\(P\\) would not be a probability measure. W.L.O.G. let \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) be uncountable. Then we have \\[\\begin{equation} A_1 \\cap A_2 = (A_1^c \\cup A_2^c)^c. \\end{equation}\\] Now \\(A_1^c\\) and \\(A_2^c\\) are countable and their union is therefore countable. Let \\(B = A_1^c \\cup A_2^c\\). So the intersection of \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) equals the complement of \\(B\\), which is countable. For the intersection to be the empty set, \\(B\\) would have to equal to \\(\\Omega\\). But \\(\\Omega\\) is uncountable and therefore \\(B\\) can not equal to \\(\\Omega\\). It follows that two uncountable sets in \\(\\mathcal{F}_3\\) can not have an empty intersection. Therefore the tuple is a legitimate probability space. 2.2 Lebesgue measure Exercise 2.6 Show that the Lebesgue measure of rational numbers on \\([0,1]\\) is 0. R: Implement a random number generator, which generates uniform samples of irrational numbers in \\([0,1]\\) by uniformly sampling from \\([0,1]\\) and rejecting a sample if it is rational. Solution. There are a countable number of rational numbers. Therefore, we can write \\[\\begin{align} \\lambda(\\mathbb{Q}) &amp;= \\lambda(\\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} q_i) &amp;\\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} \\lambda(q_i) &amp;\\text{ (countable additivity)} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} 0 &amp;\\text{ (Lebesgue measure of a singleton)} \\\\ &amp;= 0. \\end{align}\\] Exercise 2.7 Prove that the Lebesgue measure of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is infinity. Paradox. Show that the cardinality of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\((0,1)\\) is the same, while their Lebesgue measures are infinity and one respectably. Solution. Let \\(a_i\\) be the \\(i\\)-th integer for \\(i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). We can write \\(\\mathbb{R} = \\cup_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]\\). \\[\\begin{align} \\lambda(\\mathbb{R}) &amp;= \\lambda(\\cup_{i = -\\infty}^{\\infty} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda(\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\cup_{i = -n}^{n} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda(\\cup_{i = -n}^{n} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i = -n}^{n} \\lambda((a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i = -n}^{n} 1 \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} 2n \\\\ &amp;= \\infty. \\end{align}\\] We need to find a bijection between \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\((0,1)\\). A well-known function that maps from a bounded interval to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the tangent. To make the bijection easier to achieve, we will take the inverse, which maps from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). However, we need to change the function so it maps to \\((0,1)\\). First we add \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so that we move the function above zero. Then we only have to divide by the max value, which in this case is \\(\\pi\\). So our bijection is \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\frac{\\tan^{-1}(x) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\pi}. \\end{equation}\\] Exercise 2.8 Take the measure space \\((\\Omega_1 = (0,1], B_{(0,1]}, \\lambda)\\) (we know that this is a probability space on \\((0,1]\\)). Define a map (function) from \\(\\Omega_1\\) to \\(\\Omega_2 = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) such that the measure space \\((\\Omega_2, 2^{\\Omega_2}, \\lambda(f^{-1}()))\\) will be a discrete probability space with uniform probabilities (\\(P(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{6}, \\forall \\omega \\in \\Omega_2)\\). Is the map that you defined in (a) the only such map? How would you in the same fashion define a map that would result in a probability space that can be interpreted as a coin toss with probability \\(p\\) of heads? R: Use the map in (a) as a basis for a random generator for this fair die. Solution. In other words, we have to assign disjunct intervals of the same size to each element of \\(\\Omega_2\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\lceil 6x \\rceil. \\end{equation}\\] No, we could for example rearrange the order in which the intervals are mapped to integers. Additionally, we could have several disjoint intervals that mapped to the same integer, as long as the Lebesgue measure of their union would be \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) and the function would remain injective. We have \\(\\Omega_3 = \\{0,1\\}\\), where zero represents heads and one represents tails. Then \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = 0^{I_{A}(x)}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A = \\{y \\in (0,1] : y &lt; p\\}\\). set.seed(1) unif_s &lt;- runif(1000) die_s &lt;- ceiling(6 * unif_s) summary(as.factor(die_s)) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 166 154 200 146 166 168 "],

When the officer identifies an airplane as an enemy airplane, what is the probability that it is not and they will shoot at a friendly airplane? Solution.

R: Use simulation to check your answers to a) and b). Solution. Let \\(T = 1\\) denote that the toss is 1 and \\(M = 1\\) that the machine reports a 1. \\[\\begin{align} P(T = 1 | M = 1) &amp;= \\frac{P(M = 1 | T = 1)P(T = 1)}{P(M = 1)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(M = 1 | T = 1)P(T = 1)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{12} P(M = 1 | T = k)P(T = k)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{5}{6}\\frac{1}{12}}{\\frac{5}{6}\\frac{1}{12} + 11 \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{1}{11} \\frac{1}{12}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{5}{6}. \\end{align}\\] Yes. \\[\\begin{align} P(T = 1 | M = 1) &amp;= \\frac{P(M = 1 | T = 1)P(T = 1)}{P(M = 1)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(M = 1 | T = 1)P(T = 1)}{\\sum_{k=1}^{12} P(M = 1 | T = k)P(T = k)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{5}{6}\\frac{1}{12}}{\\frac{5}{6}\\frac{1}{12} + 11 \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{1}{12}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{5}{16}. \\end{align}\\] set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 10000 report_a &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;numeric&quot;, length = nsamps) report_b &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) truths &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) for (i in 1:10000) { toss &lt;- sample(1:12, size = 1) truth &lt;- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), size = 1, prob = c(5/6, 1/6)) truths[i] &lt;- truth if (truth) { report_a[i] &lt;- toss report_b[i] &lt;- toss == 1 } else { remaining &lt;- (1:12)[1:12 != toss] report_a[i] &lt;- sample(remaining, size = 1) report_b[i] &lt;- toss != 1 } } truth_a1 &lt;- truths[report_a == 1] sum(truth_a1) / length(truth_a1) ## [1] 0.8384075 truth_b1 &lt;- truths[report_b] sum(truth_b1) / length(truth_b1) ## [1] 0.3110339 Exercise 3.4 A coin is tossed independently \\(n\\) times. The probability of heads at each toss is \\(p\\). At each time \\(k\\), \\((k = 2,3,...,n)\\) we get a reward at time \\(k+1\\) if \\(k\\)-th toss was a head and the previous toss was a tail. Let \\(A_k\\) be the event that a reward is obtained at time \\(k\\). Are events \\(A_k\\) and \\(A_{k+1}\\) independent? Are events \\(A_k\\) and \\(A_{k+2}\\) independent? R: simulate 10 tosses 10000 times, where \\(p = 0.7\\). Check your answers to a) and b) by counting the frequencies of the events \\(A_5\\), \\(A_6\\), and \\(A_7\\). Solution. For \\(A_k\\) to happen, we need the tosses \\(k-2\\) and \\(k-1\\) be tails and heads respectively. For \\(A_{k+1}\\) to happen, we need tosses \\(k-1\\) and \\(k\\) be tails and heads respectively. As the toss \\(k-1\\) need to be heads for one and tails for the other, these two events can not happen simultaneously. Therefore the probability of their intersection is 0. But the probability of each of them separately is \\(p(1-p) &gt; 0\\). Therefore, they are not independent. For \\(A_k\\) to happen, we need the tosses \\(k-2\\) and \\(k-1\\) be tails and heads respectively. For \\(A_{k+2}\\) to happen, we need tosses \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\) be tails and heads respectively. So the probability of intersection is \\(p^2(1-p)^2\\). And the probability of each separately is again \\(p(1-p)\\). Therefore, they are independent. set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 10000 p &lt;- 0.7 rewardA_5 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) rewardA_6 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) rewardA_7 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) rewardA_56 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) rewardA_57 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) for (i in 1:nsamps) { samps &lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = 10, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3)) rewardA_5[i] &lt;- (samps[4] == 0 &amp; samps[3] == 1) rewardA_6[i] &lt;- (samps[5] == 0 &amp; samps[4] == 1) rewardA_7[i] &lt;- (samps[6] == 0 &amp; samps[5] == 1) rewardA_56[i] &lt;- (rewardA_5[i] &amp; rewardA_6[i]) rewardA_57[i] &lt;- (rewardA_5[i] &amp; rewardA_7[i]) } sum(rewardA_5) / nsamps ## [1] 0.2141 sum(rewardA_6) / nsamps ## [1] 0.2122 sum(rewardA_7) / nsamps ## [1] 0.2107 sum(rewardA_56) / nsamps ## [1] 0 sum(rewardA_57) / nsamps ## [1] 0.0454 Exercise 3.5 A drawer contains two coins. One is an unbiased coin, the other is a biased coin, which will turn up heads with probability \\(p\\) and tails with probability \\(1-p\\). One coin is selected uniformly at random. The selected coin is tossed \\(n\\) times. The coin turns up heads \\(k\\) times and tails \\(n-k\\) times. What is the probability that the coin is biased? The selected coin is tossed repeatedly until it turns up heads \\(k\\) times. Given that it is tossed \\(n\\) times in total, what is the probability that the coin is biased? Solution. Let \\(B = 1\\) denote that the coin is biased and let \\(H = k\\) denote that we’ve seen \\(k\\) heads. \\[\\begin{align} P(B = 1 | H = k) &amp;= \\frac{P(H = k | B = 1)P(B = 1)}{P(H = k)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(H = k | B = 1)P(B = 1)}{P(H = k | B = 1)P(B = 1) + P(H = k | B = 0)P(B = 0)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{p^k(1-p)^{n-k} 0.5}{p^k(1-p)^{n-k} 0.5 + 0.5^{n+1}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{p^k(1-p)^{n-k}}{p^k(1-p)^{n-k} + 0.5^n}. \\end{align}\\] The same results as in a). The only difference between these two scenarios is that in b) the last throw must be heads. However, this holds for the biased and the unbiased coin and therefore does not affect the probability of the coin being biased. Exercise 3.6 Judy goes around the company for Women’s day and shares flowers. In every office she leaves a flower, if there is at least one woman inside. The probability that there’s a woman in the office is \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\). What is the probability that Judy leaves her first flower in the fourth office? Given that she has given away exactly three flowers in the first four offices, what is the probability that she gives her fourth flower in the eighth office? What is the probability that she leaves the second flower in the fifth office? What is the probability that she leaves the second flower in the fifth office, given that she did not leave the second flower in the second office? Judy needs a new supply of flowers immediately after the office, where she gives away her last flower. What is the probability that she visits at least five offices, if she starts with two flowers? R: simulate Judy’s walk 10000 times to check your answers a) - e). Solution. Let \\(X_i = k\\) denote the event that … \\(i\\)-th sample on the \\(k\\)-th run. Since the events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to get \\[\\begin{equation} P(X_1 = 4) = 0.4^3 \\times 0.6 = 0.0384. \\end{equation}\\] Same as in a) as we have a fresh start after first four offices. For this to be possible, she had to leave the first flower in one of the first four offices. Therefore there are four possibilities, and for each of those the probability is \\(0.4^3 \\times 0.6\\). Additionally, the probability that she leaves a flower in the fifth office is \\(0.6\\). So \\[\\begin{equation} P(X_2 = 5) = \\binom{4}{1} \\times 0.4^3 \\times 0.6^2 = 0.09216. \\end{equation}\\] We use Bayes’ theorem. \\[\\begin{align} P(X_2 = 5 | X_2 \\neq 2) &amp;= \\frac{P(X_2 \\neq 2 | X_2 = 5)P(X_2 = 5)}{P(X_2 \\neq 2)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{0.09216}{0.64} \\\\ &amp;= 0.144. \\end{align}\\] The denominator in the second equation can be calculated as follows. One of three things has to happen for the second not to be dealt in the second round. First, both are zero, so \\(0.4^2\\). Second, first is zero, and second is one, so \\(0.4 \\times 0.6\\). Third, the first is one and the second one zero, so \\(0.6 \\times 0.4\\). Summing these values we get \\(0.64\\). We will look at the complement, so the events that she gave away exactly two flowers after two, three and four offices. \\[\\begin{equation} P(X_2 \\geq 5) = 1 - 0.6^2 - 2 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.6^2 - 3 \\times 0.4^2 \\times 0.6^2 = 0.1792. \\end{equation}\\] The multiplying parts represent the possibilities of the first flower. set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 100000 Judyswalks &lt;- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nsamps, ncol = 8) for (i in 1:nsamps) { thiswalk &lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = 8, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.4, 0.6)) Judyswalks[i, ] &lt;- thiswalk } csJudy &lt;- t(apply(Judyswalks, 1, cumsum)) # a sum(csJudy[ ,4] == 1 &amp; csJudy[ ,3] == 0) / nsamps ## [1] 0.03848 # b csJsubset &lt;- csJudy[csJudy[ ,4] == 3 &amp; csJudy[ ,3] == 2, ] sum(csJsubset[ ,8] == 4 &amp; csJsubset[ ,7] == 3) / nrow(csJsubset) ## [1] 0.03665893 # c sum(csJudy[ ,5] == 2 &amp; csJudy[ ,4] == 1) / nsamps ## [1] 0.09117 # d sum(csJudy[ ,5] == 2 &amp; csJudy[ ,4] == 1) / sum(csJudy[ ,2] != 2) ## [1] 0.1422398 # e sum(csJudy[ ,4] &lt; 2) / nsamps ## [1] 0.17818 3.2 Conditional independence Exercise 3.7 Describe: A real-world example of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that are dependent but become conditionally independent if conditioned on a third event \\(C\\). A real-world example of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that are independent, but become dependent if conditioned on some third event \\(C\\). Solution. Let \\(A\\) be the height of a person and let \\(B\\) be the person’s knowledge of the Dutch language. These events are dependent since the Dutch are known to be taller than average. However if \\(C\\) is the nationality of the person, then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent given \\(C\\). Let \\(A\\) be the event that Mary passes the exam and let \\(B\\) be the event that John passes the exam. These events are independent. However, if the event \\(C\\) is that Mary and John studied together, then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are conditionally dependent given \\(C\\). Exercise 3.8 We have two coins of identical appearance. We know that one is a fair coin and the other flips heads 80% of the time. We choose one of the two coins uniformly at random. We discard the coin that was not chosen. We now flip the chosen coin independently 10 times, producing a sequence \\(Y_1 = y_1\\), \\(Y_2 = y_2\\), …, \\(Y_{10} = y_{10}\\). Intuitively, without doing and computation, are these random variables independent? Compute the probability \\(P(Y_1 = 1)\\). Compute the probabilities \\(P(Y_2 = 1 | Y_1 = 1)\\) and P(Y_{10} = 1 | Y_1 = 1,…,Y_9 = 1)$. Given your answers to b) and c), would you now change your answer to a)? If so, discuss why your intuition had failed. Solution. \\(P(Y_1 = 1) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.65\\). Since we know that \\(Y_1 = 1\\) this should change our view of the probability of the coin being biased or not. Let \\(B = 1\\) denote the event that the coin is biased and let \\(B = 0\\) denote that the coin is unbiased. By using marginal probability, we can write \\[\\begin{align} P(Y_2 = 1 | Y_1 = 1) &amp;= P(Y_2 = 1, B = 1 | Y_1 = 1) + P(Y_2 = 1, B = 0 | Y_1 = 1) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^2 P(Y_2 = 1 | B = k, Y_1 = 1)P(B = k | Y_1 = 1) \\\\ &amp;= 0.8 \\frac{P(Y_1 = 1 | B = 1)P(B = 1)}{P(Y_1 = 1)} + 0.5 \\frac{P(Y_1 = 1 | B = 0)P(B = 0)}{P(Y_1 = 1)} \\\\ &amp;= 0.8 \\frac{0.8 \\times 0.5}{0.65} + 0.5 \\frac{0.5 \\times 0.5}{0.65} \\\\ &amp;\\approx 0.68. \\end{align}\\] For the other calculation we follow the same procedure. Let \\(X = 1\\) denote that first nine tosses are all heads (equivalent to \\(Y_1 = 1\\),…, \\(Y_9 = 1\\)). \\[\\begin{align} P(Y_{10} = 1 | X = 1) &amp;= P(Y_2 = 1, B = 1 | X = 1) + P(Y_2 = 1, B = 0 | X = 1) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^2 P(Y_2 = 1 | B = k, X = 1)P(B = k | X = 1) \\\\ &amp;= 0.8 \\frac{P(X = 1 | B = 1)P(B = 1)}{P(X = 1)} + 0.5 \\frac{P(X = 1 | B = 0)P(B = 0)}{P(X = 1)} \\\\ &amp;= 0.8 \\frac{0.8^9 \\times 0.5}{0.5 \\times 0.8^9 + 0.5 \\times 0.5^9} + 0.5 \\frac{0.5^9 \\times 0.5}{0.5 \\times 0.8^9 + 0.5 \\times 0.5^9} \\\\ &amp;\\approx 0.8. \\end{align}\\] 3.3 Monty Hall problem The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle with non-intuitive outcome. Many established mathematicians and statisticians had problems solving it and many even disregarded the correct solution until they’ve seen the proof by simulation. Here we will show how it can be solved relatively simply with the use of Bayes’ theorem if we select the variables in a smart way. Exercise 3.9 (Monty Hall problem) A prize is placed at random behind one of three doors. You pick a door. Now Monty Hall chooses one of the other two doors, opens it and shows you that it is empty. He then gives you the opportunity to keep your door or switch to the other unopened door. Should you stay or switch? Use Bayes’ theorem to calculate the probability of winning if you switch and if you do not. R: Check your answers in R. Solution. W.L.O.G. assume we always pick the first door. The host can only open door 2 or door 3, as he can not open the door we picked. Let \\(k \\in \\{2,3\\}\\). Let us first look at what happens if we do not change. Then we have \\[\\begin{align} P(\\text{car in 1} | \\text{open $k$}) &amp;= \\frac{P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in 1})P(\\text{car in 1})}{P(\\text{open $k$})} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in 1})P(\\text{car in 1})}{\\sum_{n=1}^3 P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in $n$})P(\\text{car in $n$)}}. \\end{align}\\] The probability that he opened \\(k\\) if the car is in 1 is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), as he can choose between door 2 and 3 as both have a goat behind it. Let us look at the normalization constant. When \\(n = 1\\) we get the value in the nominator. When \\(n=k\\), we get 0, as he will not open the door if there’s a prize behind. The remaining option is that we select 1, the car is behind \\(k\\) and he opens the only door left. Since he can’t open 1 due to it being our pick and \\(k\\) due to having the prize, the probability of opening the remaining door is 1, and the prior probability of the car being behind this door is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). So we have \\[\\begin{align} P(\\text{car in 1} | \\text{open $k$}) &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{3}. \\end{align}\\] Now let us look at what happens if we do change. Let \\(k&#39; \\in \\{2,3\\}\\) be the door that is not opened. If we change, we select this door, so we have \\[\\begin{align} P(\\text{car in $k&#39;$} | \\text{open $k$}) &amp;= \\frac{P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in $k&#39;$})P(\\text{car in $k&#39;$})}{P(\\text{open $k$})} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in $k&#39;$})P(\\text{car in $k&#39;$})}{\\sum_{n=1}^3 P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in $n$})P(\\text{car in $n$)}}. \\end{align}\\] The denominator stays the same, the only thing that is different from before is \\(P(\\text{open $k$} | \\text{car in $k&#39;$})\\). We have a situation where we initially selected door 1 and the car is in door \\(k&#39;\\). The probability that the host will open door \\(k\\) is then 1, as he can not pick any other door. So we have \\[\\begin{align} P(\\text{car in $k&#39;$} | \\text{open $k$}) &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2}{3}. \\end{align}\\] Therefore it makes sense to change the door. set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 1000 ifchange &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) ifstay &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = nsamps) for (i in 1:nsamps) { where_car &lt;- sample(c(1:3), 1) where_player &lt;- sample(c(1:3), 1) open_samp &lt;- (1:3)[where_car != (1:3) &amp; where_player != (1:3)] if (length(open_samp) == 1) { where_open &lt;- open_samp } else { where_open &lt;- sample(open_samp, 1) } ifstay[i] &lt;- where_car == where_player where_ifchange &lt;- (1:3)[where_open != (1:3) &amp; where_player != (1:3)] ifchange[i] &lt;- where_ifchange == where_car } sum(ifstay) / nsamps ## [1] 0.333 sum(ifchange) / nsamps ## [1] 0.667 "],

Find their respective densities. R: Plot the three functions. \\[\\begin{equation} F(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 - e^{-x^2} &amp; x \\geq 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; x &lt; 0. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} F(x) = \\begin{cases} e^{-\\frac{1}{x}} &amp; x &gt; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; x \\leq 0. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} F(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x \\leq 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} &amp; 0 &lt; x \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 1 &amp; x &gt; \\frac{1}{2}. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Solution. Yes. First, let us check the limits. \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow -\\infty} (0) = 0\\). \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} (1 - e^{-x^2}) = 1 - \\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} e^{-x^2} = 1 - 0 = 1\\). Second, let us check whether the function is increasing. Let \\(x &gt; y \\geq 0\\). Then \\(1 - e^{-x^2} \\geq 1 - e^{-y^2}\\). We only have to check right continuity for the point zero. \\(F(0) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0}F (0 + \\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} 1 - e^{-\\epsilon^2} = 1 - \\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} e^{-\\epsilon^2} = 1 - 1 = 0\\). We get the density by differentiating the CDF. \\(p(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} 1 - e^{-x^2} = 2xe^{-x^2}.\\) Students are encouraged to check that this is a proper PDF. Yes. First, let us check the limits. $_{x -} (0) = 0 and \\(\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} (e^{-\\frac{1}{x}}) = 1\\). Second, let us check whether the function is increasing. Let \\(x &gt; y \\geq 0\\). Then \\(e^{-\\frac{1}{x}} \\geq e^{-\\frac{1}{y}}\\). We only have to check right continuity for the point zero. \\(F(0) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0}F (0 + \\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} e^{-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}} = 0\\). We get the density by differentiating the CDF. \\(p(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} e^{-\\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{1}{x^2}e^{-\\frac{1}{x}}.\\) Students are encouraged to check that this is a proper PDF. No. The function is not right continuous as \\(F(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\), but \\(\\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} F(\\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon) = 1\\). f1 &lt;- function (x) { tmp &lt;- 1 - exp(-x^2) tmp[x &lt; 0] &lt;- 0 return(tmp) } f2 &lt;- function (x) { tmp &lt;- exp(-(1 / x)) tmp[x &lt;= 0] &lt;- 0 return(tmp) } f3 &lt;- function (x) { tmp &lt;- x tmp[x == x] &lt;- 1 tmp[x &lt;= 0.5] &lt;- 1/3 tmp[x &lt;= 0] &lt;- 0 return(tmp) } cdf_data &lt;- tibble(x = seq(-1, 20, by = 0.001), f1 = f1(x), f2 = f2(x), f3 = f3(x)) %&gt;% melt(id.vars = &quot;x&quot;) cdf_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = cdf_data, aes(x = x, y = value, color = variable)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 1) + geom_line() plot(cdf_plot) Exercise 4.2 Let \\(X\\) be a random variable with CDF \\[\\begin{equation} F(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; x &lt; 0 \\\\ \\frac{x^2}{2} &amp; 0 \\leq x &lt; 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{p}{2} &amp; 1 \\leq x &lt; 2 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{1 - p}{2} &amp; x \\geq 2 \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] R: Plot this CDF for \\(p = 0.3\\). Is it a discrete, continuous, or mixed random varible? Find the probability density/mass of \\(X\\). f1 &lt;- function (x, p) { tmp &lt;- x tmp[x &gt;= 2] &lt;- 0.5 + (p * 0.5) + ((1-p) * 0.5) tmp[x &lt; 2] &lt;- 0.5 + (p * 0.5) tmp[x &lt; 1] &lt;- (x[x &lt; 1])^2 / 2 tmp[x &lt; 0] &lt;- 0 return(tmp) } cdf_data &lt;- tibble(x = seq(-1, 5, by = 0.001), y = f1(x, 0.3)) cdf_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = cdf_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 1) + geom_line(color = &quot;blue&quot;) plot(cdf_plot) Solution. \\(X\\) is a mixed random variable. Since \\(X\\) is a mixed random variable, we have to find the PDF of the continuous part and the PMF of the discrete part. We get the continuous part by differentiating the corresponding CDF, \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{x^2}{2} = x\\). So the PDF, when \\(0 \\leq x &lt; 1\\), is \\(p(x) = x\\). Let us look at the discrete part now. It has two steps, so this is a discrete distribution with two outcomes – numbers 1 and 2. The first happens with probability \\(\\frac{p}{2}\\), and the second with probability \\(\\frac{1 - p}{2}\\). This reminds us of the Bernoulli distribution. The PMF for the discrete part is \\(P(X = x) = (\\frac{p}{2})^{2 - x} (\\frac{1 - p}{2})^{x - 1}\\). Exercise 4.3 (Convolutions) Convolutions are probability distributions that correspond to sums of independent random variables. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be independent discrete variables. Find the PMF of \\(Z = X + Y\\). Hint: Use the law of total probability. Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be independent continuous variables. Find the PDF of \\(Z = X + Y\\). Hint: Start with the CDF. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P(Z = z) &amp;= P(X + Y = z) &amp; \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = -\\infty}^\\infty P(X + Y = z | Y = k) P(Y = k) &amp; \\text{ (law of total probability)} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = -\\infty}^\\infty P(X + k = z | Y = k) P(Y = k) &amp; \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = -\\infty}^\\infty P(X + k = z) P(Y = k) &amp; \\text{ (independence of $X$ and $Y$)} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = -\\infty}^\\infty P(X = z - k) P(Y = k). &amp; \\end{align}\\] Let \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) be the PDFs of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) respectively. \\[\\begin{align} F(z) &amp;= P(Z &lt; z) \\\\ &amp;= P(X + Y &lt; z) \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(X + Y &lt; z | Y = y)P(Y = y)dy \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(X + y &lt; z | Y = y)P(Y = y)dy \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(X + y &lt; z)P(Y = y)dy \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(X &lt; z - y)P(Y = y)dy \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (\\int_{-\\infty}^{z - y} f(x) dx) g(y) dy \\end{align}\\] Now \\[\\begin{align} p(z) &amp;= \\frac{d}{dz} F(z) &amp; \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (\\frac{d}{dz}\\int_{-\\infty}^{z - y} f(x) dx) g(y) dy &amp; \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(z - y) g(y) dy &amp; \\text{ (fundamental theorem of calculus)}. \\end{align}\\] 4.2 Discrete random variables Exercise 4.4 (Binomial random variable) Let \\(X_k\\), \\(k = 1,...,n\\), be random variables with the Bernoulli measure as the PMF. Let \\(X = \\sum_{k=1}^n X_k\\). We call \\(X_k\\) a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \\(p \\in (0,1)\\). Find the CDF of \\(X_k\\). Find PMF of \\(X\\). This is a Binomial random variable with support in \\(\\{0,1,2,...,n\\}\\) and parameters \\(p \\in (0,1)\\) and \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\). We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | n,p \\sim \\text{binomial}(n,p). \\end{equation}\\] Find CDF of \\(X\\). R: Simulate from the binomial distribution with \\(n = 10\\) and \\(p = 0.5\\), and from \\(n\\) Bernoulli distributions with \\(p = 0.5\\). Visually compare the sum of Bernoullis and the binomial. Hint: there is no standard function like rpois for a Bernoulli random variable. Check exercise 1.11 to find out how to sample from a Bernoulli distribution. Solution. There are two outcomes – zero and one. Zero happens with probability \\(1 - p\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{equation} F(k) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; k &lt; 0 \\\\ 1 - p &amp; 0 \\leq k &lt; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; k \\geq 1. \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] For the probability of \\(X\\) to be equal to some \\(k \\leq n\\), exactly \\(k\\) Bernoulli variables need to be one, and the others zero. So \\(p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\). There are \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) such possible arrangements. Therefore \\[\\begin{align} P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n-k}. \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} F(k) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{\\lfloor k \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1 - p)^{n - i} \\end{equation}\\] set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 10000 binom_samp &lt;- rbinom(nsamps, size = 10, prob = 0.5) bernoulli_mat &lt;- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nsamps, ncol = 10) for (i in 1:nsamps) { bernoulli_mat[i, ] &lt;- rbinom(10, size = 1, prob = 0.5) } bern_samp &lt;- apply(bernoulli_mat, 1, sum) b_data &lt;- tibble(x = c(binom_samp, bern_samp), type = c(rep(&quot;binomial&quot;, 10000), rep(&quot;Bernoulli_sum&quot;, 10000))) b_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = b_data, aes(x = x, fill = type)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) plot(b_plot) Exercise 4.5 (Geometric random variable) A variable with PMF \\[\\begin{equation} P(k) = p(1-p)^k \\end{equation}\\] is a geometric random variable with support in non-negative integers. It has one parameter \\(p \\in (0,1]\\). We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | p \\sim \\text{geometric}(p) \\end{equation}\\] Derive the CDF of a geometric random variable. R: Draw 1000 samples from the geometric distribution with \\(p = 0.3\\) and compare their frequencies to theoretical values. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P(X \\leq k) &amp;= \\sum_{i = 0}^k p(1-p)^i \\\\ &amp;= p \\sum_{i = 0}^k (1-p)^i \\\\ &amp;= p \\frac{1 - (1-p)^{k+1}}{1 - (1 - p)} \\\\ &amp;= 1 - (1-p)^{k + 1} \\end{align}\\] set.seed(1) geo_samp &lt;- rgeom(n = 1000, prob = 0.3) geo_samp &lt;- data.frame(x = geo_samp) %&gt;% count(x) %&gt;% mutate(n = n / 1000, type = &quot;empirical_frequencies&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(data.frame(x = 0:20, n = dgeom(0:20, prob = 0.3), type = &quot;theoretical_measure&quot;)) geo_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = geo_samp, aes(x = x, y = n, fill = type)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) plot(geo_plot) Exercise 4.6 (Poisson random variable) A variable with PMF \\[\\begin{equation} P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\end{equation}\\] is a Poisson random variable with support in non-negative integers. It has one positive parameter \\(\\lambda\\), which also represents its mean value and variance (a measure of the deviation of the values from the mean – more on mean and variance in the next chapter). We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | \\lambda \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda). \\end{equation}\\] This distribution is usually the default choice for modeling counts. We have already encountered a Poisson random variable in exercise 1.12, where we also sampled from this distribution. The CDF of a Poisson random variable is \\(P(X &lt;= x) = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{i=0}^x \\frac{\\lambda^{i}}{i!}\\). R: Draw 1000 samples from the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 5\\) and compare their empirical cumulative distribution function with the theoretical CDF. set.seed(1) pois_samp &lt;- rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 5) pois_samp &lt;- data.frame(x = pois_samp) pois_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = pois_samp, aes(x = x, colour = &quot;ECDF&quot;)) + stat_ecdf(geom = &quot;step&quot;) + geom_step(data = tibble(x = 0:17, y = ppois(x, 5)), aes(x = x, y = y, colour = &quot;CDF&quot;)) + scale_colour_manual(&quot;Lgend title&quot;, values = c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)) plot(pois_plot) Exercise 4.7 (Negative binomial random variable) A variable with PMF \\[\\begin{equation} p(k) = \\binom{k + r - 1}{k}(1-p)^r p^k \\end{equation}\\] is a negative binomial random variable with support in non-negative integers. It has two parameters \\(r &gt; 0\\) and \\(p \\in (0,1)\\). We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | r,p \\sim \\text{NB}(r,p). \\end{equation}\\] Let us reparameterize the negative binomial distribution with \\(q = 1 - p\\). Find the PMF of \\(X \\sim \\text{NB}(1, q)\\). Do you recognize this distribution? Show that the sum of two negative binomial random variables with the same \\(p\\) is also a negative binomial random variable. Hint: Use the fact that the number of ways to place \\(n\\) indistinct balls into \\(k\\) boxes is \\(\\binom{n + k - 1}{n}\\). R: Draw samples from \\(X \\sim \\text{NB}(5, 0.4)\\) and \\(Y \\sim \\text{NB}(3, 0.4)\\). Draw samples from \\(Z = X + Y\\), where you use the parameters calculated in b). Plot both distributions, their sum, and \\(Z\\) using facet_wrap. Be careful, as R uses a different parameterization size=\\(r\\) and prob=\\(1 - p\\). Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P(X = k) &amp;= \\binom{k + 1 - 1}{k}q^1 (1-q)^k \\\\ &amp;= q(1-q)^k. \\end{align}\\] This is the geometric distribution. Let \\(X \\sim \\text{NB}(r_1, p)\\) and \\(Y \\sim \\text{NB}(r_2, p)\\). Let \\(Z = X + Y\\). \\[\\begin{align} P(Z = z) &amp;= \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} P(X = z - k)P(Y = k), \\text{ if k &lt; 0, then the probabilities are 0} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = 0}^{z} P(X = z - k)P(Y = k), \\text{ if k &gt; z, then the probabilities are 0} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = 0}^{z} \\binom{z - k + r_1 - 1}{z - k}(1 - p)^{r_1} p^{z - k} \\binom{k + r_2 - 1}{k}(1 - p)^{r_2} p^{k} &amp; \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k = 0}^{z} \\binom{z - k + r_1 - 1}{z - k} \\binom{k + r_2 - 1}{k}(1 - p)^{r_1 + r_2} p^{z} &amp; \\\\ &amp;= (1 - p)^{r_1 + r_2} p^{z} \\sum_{k = 0}^{z} \\binom{z - k + r_1 - 1}{z - k} \\binom{k + r_2 - 1}{k}&amp; \\end{align}\\] The part before the sum reminds us of the negative binomial distribution with parameters \\(r_1 + r_2\\) and \\(p\\). To complete this term to the negative binomial PMF we need \\(\\binom{z + r_1 + r_2 -1}{z}\\). So the only thing we need to prove is that the sum equals this term. Both terms in the sum can be interpreted as numbers of ways to place a number of balls into boxes. For the left term it is \\(z-k\\) balls into \\(r_1\\) boxes, and for the right \\(k\\) balls into \\(r_2\\) boxes. For each \\(k\\) we are distributing \\(z\\) balls in total. By summing over all \\(k\\), we actually get all the possible placements of \\(z\\) balls into \\(r_1 + r_2\\) boxes. Therefore \\[\\begin{align} P(Z = z) &amp;= (1 - p)^{r_1 + r_2} p^{z} \\sum_{k = 0}^{z} \\binom{z - k + r_1 - 1}{z - k} \\binom{k + r_2 - 1}{k}&amp; \\\\ &amp;= \\binom{z + r_1 + r_2 -1}{z} (1 - p)^{r_1 + r_2} p^{z}. \\end{align}\\] From this it also follows that the sum of geometric distributions with the same parameter is a negative binomial distribution. \\(Z \\sim \\text{NB}(8, 0.4)\\). set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 10000 x &lt;- rnbinom(nsamps, size = 5, prob = 0.6) y &lt;- rnbinom(nsamps, size = 3, prob = 0.6) xpy &lt;- x + y z &lt;- rnbinom(nsamps, size = 8, prob = 0.6) samps &lt;- tibble(x, y, xpy, z) samps &lt;- melt(samps) ggplot(data = samps, aes(x = value)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ variable) 4.3 Continuous random variables Exercise 4.8 (Exponential random variable) A variable \\(X\\) with PDF \\(\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}\\) is an exponential random variable with support in non-negative real numbers. It has one positive parameter \\(\\lambda\\). We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | \\lambda \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda). \\end{equation}\\] Find the CDF of an exponential random variable. Find the quantile function of an exponential random variable. Calculate the probability \\(P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)\\), where \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp(1.5)}\\).

It has two positive parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Notation: \\[\\begin{equation} X | \\alpha, \\beta \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\end{equation}\\] It is often used in modeling rates. Calculate the PDF for \\(\\alpha = 1\\) and \\(\\beta = 1\\). What do you notice? R: Plot densities of the beta distribution for parameter pairs (2, 2), (4, 1), (1, 4), (2, 5), and (0.1, 0.1).

We write \\[\\begin{equation} X | \\alpha, \\beta \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta) \\end{equation}\\] and it’s CDF is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\gamma(\\alpha, \\beta x)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma(s, x) = \\int_0^x t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt\\).

Let \\(k = \\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\). Find the PDF of \\(X | k, \\theta \\sim \\text{Gamma}(k, \\theta)\\). Random variables can be reparameterized, and sometimes a reparameterized distribution is more suitable for certain calculations. The first parameterization is for example usually used in Bayesian statistics, while this parameterization is more common in econometrics and some other applied fields. Note that you also need to pay attention to the parameters in statistical software, so diligently read the help files when using functions like rgamma to see how the function is parameterized. R: Plot gamma CDF for random variables with shape and rate parameters (1,1), (10,1), (1,10).

The first is the mean parameter and the second is the variance parameter. Many statistical methods assume a normal distribution. We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | \\mu, \\sigma \\sim \\text{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] and it’s CDF is \\[\\begin{equation} F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(t - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} dt, \\end{equation}\\] which is intractable and is usually approximated. Due to its flexibility it is also one of the most researched distributions. For that reason statisticians often use transformations of variables or approximate distributions with the normal distribution. Show that a variable \\(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim \\text{N}(0,1)\\). This transformation is called standardization, and \\(\\text{N}(0,1)\\) is a standard normal distribution. R: Plot the normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 0\\) and different values for the \\(\\sigma\\) parameter. R: The normal distribution provides a good approximation for the Poisson distribution with a large \\(\\lambda\\). Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(50)\\). Approximate \\(X\\) with the normal distribution and compare its density with the Poisson histogram. What are the values of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) that should provide the best approximation? Note that R function rnorm takes standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) as a parameter and not variance. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} &lt; x) &amp;= P(X &lt; \\sigma x + \\mu) \\\\ &amp;= F(\\sigma x + \\mu) \\\\ &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\sigma x + \\mu} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(t - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} dt \\end{align}\\] Now let \\(s = f(t) = \\frac{t - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\), then \\(ds = \\frac{dt}{\\sigma}\\) and \\(f(\\sigma x + \\mu) = x\\), so \\[\\begin{align} P(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} &lt; x) &amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{s^2}{2}} ds. \\end{align}\\] There is no need to evaluate this integral, as we recognize it as the CDF of a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\). set.seed(1) # b ggplot(data = data.frame(x = seq(-15, 15, by = 0.01)), aes(x = x)) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), aes(color = &quot;sd = 1&quot;)) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 0.4), aes(color = &quot;sd = 0.1&quot;)) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 2), aes(color = &quot;sd = 2&quot;)) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 5), aes(color = &quot;sd = 5&quot;)) # c mean_par &lt;- 50 nsamps &lt;- 100000 pois_samps &lt;- rpois(nsamps, lambda = mean_par) norm_samps &lt;- rnorm(nsamps, mean = mean_par, sd = sqrt(mean_par)) my_plot &lt;- ggplot() + geom_bar(data = tibble(x = pois_samps), aes(x = x, y = (..count..)/sum(..count..))) + geom_density(data = tibble(x = norm_samps), aes(x = x), color = &quot;red&quot;) plot(my_plot) Exercise 4.13 (Logistic random variable) A logistic random variable has CDF \\[\\begin{equation} F(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\frac{x - \\mu}{s}}}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is real and \\(s &gt; 0\\). The support is on the real axis. We denote \\[\\begin{equation} X | \\mu, s \\sim \\text{Logistic}(\\mu, s). \\end{equation}\\] The distribution of the logistic random variable resembles a normal random variable, however it has heavier tails. Find the PDF of a logistic random variable. R: Implement logistic PDF and CDF and visually compare both for \\(X \\sim \\text{N}(0, 1)\\) and \\(Y \\sim \\text{logit}(0, \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{\\pi^2}})\\). These distributions have the same mean and variance. Additionally, plot the same plot on the interval [5,10], to better see the difference in the tails.

For example, in the first iteration, we get the sets \\([0,\\frac{1}{3}]\\) and \\([\\frac{2}{3},1]\\). In the second iteration, we get \\([0,\\frac{1}{9}]\\), \\([\\frac{2}{9},\\frac{1}{3}]\\), \\([\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{7}{9}]\\), and \\([\\frac{8}{9}, 1]\\). On the \\(n\\)-th iteration, we have \\[\\begin{equation} C_n = \\frac{C_{n-1}}{3} \\cup \\bigg(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{C_{n-1}}{3} \\bigg), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_0 = [0,1]\\). The Cantor set is then defined as the intersection of these sets \\[\\begin{equation} C = \\cap_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n. \\end{equation}\\] It has the same cardinality as \\([0,1]\\). Another way to define the Cantor set is the set of all numbers on \\([0,1]\\), that do not have a 1 in the ternary representation \\(x = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{x_i}{3^i}, x_i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}\\). A random variable follows the Cantor distribution, if its CDF is the Cantor function (below). You can find the implementations of random number generator, CDF, and quantile functions for the Cantor distributions at https://github.com/Henrygb/CantorDist.R. Show that the Lebesgue measure of the Cantor set is 0. (Jagannathan) Let us look at an infinite sequence of independent fair-coin tosses. If the outcome is heads, let \\(x_i = 2\\) and \\(x_i = 0\\), when tails. Then use these to create \\(x = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{x_i}{3^i}\\). This is a random variable with the Cantor distribution. Show that \\(X\\) has a singular distribution. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} \\lambda(C) &amp;= 1 - \\lambda(C^c) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{k = 0}^\\infty (\\frac{2}{3})^k \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} \\\\ &amp;= 0. \\end{align}\\] First, for every \\(x\\), the probability of observing it is \\(\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} = 0\\). Second, the probability that we observe one of all the possible sequences is 1. Therefore \\(P(C) = 1\\). So this is a singular variable. The CDF only increments on the elements of the Cantor set. 4.5 Transformations Exercise 4.15 Let \\(X\\) be a random variable that is uniformly distributed on \\(\\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}\\). Find the PMF of \\(Y = X^2\\). Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P_Y(y) = \\sum_{x \\in \\sqrt(y)} P_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; y \\notin \\{0,1,4\\} \\\\ \\frac{1}{5} &amp; y = 0 \\\\ \\frac{2}{5} &amp; y \\in \\{1,4\\} \\end{cases} \\end{align}\\] Exercise 4.16 (Lognormal random variable) A lognormal random variable is a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. In practice, we often encounter skewed data. Usually using a log transformation on such data makes it more symmetric and therefore more suitable for modeling with the normal distribution (more on why we wish to model data with the normal distribution in the following chapters). Let \\(X \\sim \\text{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)\\). Find the PDF of \\(Y: \\log(Y) = X\\). R: Sample from the lognormal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu = 5\\) and \\(\\sigma = 2\\). Plot a histogram of the samples. Then log-transform the samples and plot a histogram along with the theoretical normal PDF. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} p_Y(y) &amp;= p_X(\\log(y)) \\frac{d}{dy} \\log(y) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{\\frac{(\\log(y) - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} \\frac{1}{y} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{y \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{\\frac{(\\log(y) - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}. \\end{align}\\] set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 10000 mu &lt;- 0.5 sigma &lt;- 0.4 ln_samps &lt;- rlnorm(nsamps, mu, sigma) ln_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = ln_samps), aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;black&quot;) plot(ln_plot) norm_samps &lt;- log(ln_samps) n_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = norm_samps), aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color = &quot;black&quot;) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mu, sd = sigma), color = &quot;red&quot;) plot(n_plot) Exercise 4.17 (Probability integral transform) This exercise is borrowed from Wasserman. Let \\(X\\) have a continuous, strictly increasing CDF \\(F\\). Let \\(Y = F(X)\\). Find the density of \\(Y\\). This is called the probability integral transform. Let \\(U \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\) and let \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\). Show that \\(X \\sim F\\). R: Implement a program that takes Uniform(0,1) random variables and generates random variables from an exponential(\\(\\beta\\)) distribution. Compare your implemented function with function rexp in R. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} F_Y(y) &amp;= P(Y &lt; y) \\\\ &amp;= P(F(X) &lt; y) \\\\ &amp;= P(X &lt; F_X^{-1}(y)) \\\\ &amp;= F_X(F_X^{-1}(y)) \\\\ &amp;= y. \\end{align}\\] From the above it follows that \\(p(y) = 1\\). Note that we need to know the inverse CDF to be able to apply this procedure. \\[\\begin{align} P(X &lt; x) &amp;= P(F^{-1}(U) &lt; x) \\\\ &amp;= P(U &lt; F(x)) \\\\ &amp;= F_U(F(x)) \\\\ &amp;= F(x). \\end{align}\\] set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 10000 beta &lt;- 4 generate_exp &lt;- function (n, beta) { tmp &lt;- runif(n) X &lt;- qexp(tmp, beta) return (X) } df &lt;- tibble(&quot;R&quot; = rexp(nsamps, beta), &quot;myGenerator&quot; = generate_exp(nsamps, beta)) %&gt;% gather() ggplot(data = df, aes(x = value, fill = key)) + geom_histogram(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) "],

Let \\(n\\) be the number of trials, and \\(X\\) a multivariate random variable, the collection of \\(X_i\\). Then \\(p(x) = \\frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!...x_k!} p_1^{x_1} p_2^{x_2}...p_k^{x_k}\\) is the PMF of a multinomial distribution, where \\(n = \\sum_{i = 1}^k x_i\\). Show that the marginal distribution of \\(X_i\\) is a binomial distribution. Take 1000 samples from the multinomial distribution with \\(n=4\\) and probabilities \\(p = (0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1)\\). Then take 1000 samples from four binomial distributions with the same parameters. Inspect the results visually. Solution. We will approach this proof from the probabilistic point of view. W.L.O.G. let \\(x_1\\) be the marginal distribution we are interested in. The term \\(p^{x_1}\\) denotes the probability that event 1 happened \\(x_1\\) times. For this event not to happen, one of the other events needs to happen. So for each of the remaining trials, the probability of another event is \\(\\sum_{i=2}^k p_i = 1 - p_1\\), and there were \\(n - x_1\\) such trials. What is left to do is to calculate the number of permutations of event 1 happening and event 1 not happening. We choose \\(x_1\\) trials, from \\(n\\) trials. Therefore \\(p(x_1) = \\binom{n}{x_1} p_1^{x_1} (1 - p_1)^{n - x_1}\\), which is the binomial PMF. Interested students are encouraged to prove this mathematically. set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 1000 samps_mult &lt;- rmultinom(nsamps, 4, prob = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1)) samps_mult &lt;- as_tibble(t(samps_mult)) %&gt;% gather() samps &lt;- tibble( V1 = rbinom(nsamps, 4, 0.2), V2 = rbinom(nsamps, 4, 0.2), V3 = rbinom(nsamps, 4, 0.5), V4 = rbinom(nsamps, 4, 0.1) ) %&gt;% gather() %&gt;% bind_rows(samps_mult) %&gt;% bind_cols(&quot;dist&quot; = c(rep(&quot;binomial&quot;, 4*nsamps), rep(&quot;multinomial&quot;, 4*nsamps))) ggplot(samps, aes(x = value, fill = dist)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ key) Exercise 8.2 (Multinomial expected value) Find the expected value, variance and covariance of the multinomial distribution. Hint: First find the expected value for \\(n = 1\\) and then use the fact that the trials are independent. Solution. Let us first calculate the expected value of \\(X_1\\), when \\(n = 1\\). \\[\\begin{align} E[X_1] &amp;= \\sum_{n_1 = 0}^1 \\sum_{n_2 = 0}^1 ... \\sum_{n_k = 0}^1 \\frac{1}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}...p_k^{n_k}n_1 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{n_1 = 0}^1 \\frac{p_1^{n_1} n_1}{n_1!} \\sum_{n_2 = 0}^1 ... \\sum_{n_k = 0}^1 \\frac{1}{n_2!...n_k!}p_2^{n_2}...p_k^{n_k} \\end{align}\\] When \\(n_1 = 0\\) then the whole terms is zero, so we do not need to evaluate other sums. When \\(n_1 = 1\\), all other \\(n_i\\) must be zero, as we have \\(1 = \\sum_{i=1}^k n_i\\). Therefore the other sums equal \\(1\\). So \\(E[X_1] = p_1\\) and \\(E[X_i] = p_i\\) for \\(i = 1,...,k\\). Now let \\(Y_j\\), \\(j = 1,...,n\\), have a multinomial distribution with \\(n = 1\\), and let \\(X\\) have a multinomial distribution with an arbitrary \\(n\\). Then we can write \\(X = \\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j\\). And due to independence \\[\\begin{align} E[X] &amp;= E[\\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j] \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^n E[Y_j] \\\\ &amp;= np. \\end{align}\\] For the variance, we need \\(E[X^2]\\). Let us follow the same procedure as above and first calculate \\(E[X_i]\\) for \\(n = 1\\). The only thing that changes is that the term \\(n_i\\) becomes \\(n_i^2\\). Since we only have \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) this does not change the outcome. So \\[\\begin{align} Var[X_i] &amp;= E[X_i^2] - E[X_i]^2\\\\ &amp;= p_i(1 - p_i). \\end{align}\\] Analogous to above for arbitrary \\(n\\) \\[\\begin{align} Var[X] &amp;= E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^n E[Y_j^2] - \\sum_{j=1}^n E[Y_j]^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^n E[Y_j^2] - E[Y_j]^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^n p(1-p) \\\\ &amp;= np(1-p). \\end{align}\\] To calculate the covariance, we need \\(E[X_i X_j]\\). Again, let us start with \\(n = 1\\). Without loss of generality, let us assume \\(i = 1\\) and \\(j = 2\\). \\[\\begin{align} E[X_1 X_2] = \\sum_{n_1 = 0}^1 \\sum_{n_2 = 0}^1 \\frac{p_1^{n_1} n_1}{n_1!} \\frac{p_2^{n_2} n_2}{n_2!} \\sum_{n_3 = 0}^1 ... \\sum_{n_k = 0}^1 \\frac{1}{n_3!...n_k!}p_3^{n_3}...p_k^{n_k}. \\end{align}\\] In the above expression, at each iteration we multiply with \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). Since \\(n = 1\\), one of these always has to be zero. Therefore \\(E[X_1 X_2] = 0\\) and \\[\\begin{align} Cov(X_i, X_j) &amp;= E[X_i X_j] - E[X_i]E[X_j] \\\\ &amp;= - p_i p_j. \\end{align}\\] For arbitrary \\(n\\), let \\(X = \\sum_{t = 1}^n Y_t\\) be the sum of independent multinomial random variables \\(Y_t = [X_{1t}, X_{2t},...,X_{kt}]^T\\) with \\(n=1\\). Then \\(X_1 = \\sum_{t = 1}^n X_{1t}\\) and \\(X_2 = \\sum_{l = 1}^n X_{2l}\\). \\[\\begin{align} Cov(X_1, X_2) &amp;= E[X_1 X_2] - E[X_1] E[X_2] \\\\ &amp;= E[\\sum_{t = 1}^n X_{1t} \\sum_{l = 1}^n X_{2l}] - n^2 p_1 p_2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{t = 1}^n \\sum_{l = 1}^n E[X_{1t} X_{2l}] - n^2 p_1 p_2. \\end{align}\\] For \\(X_{1t}\\) and \\(X_{2l}\\) the expected value is zero when \\(t = l\\). When \\(t \\neq l\\) then they are independent, so the expected value is the product \\(p_1 p_2\\). There are \\(n^2\\) total terms, and for \\(n\\) of them \\(t = l\\) holds. So \\(E[X_1 X_2] = (n^2 - n) p_1 p_2\\). Inserting into the above \\[\\begin{align} Cov(X_1, X_2) &amp;= (n^2 - n) p_1 p_2 - n^2 p_1 p_2 \\\\ &amp;= - n p_1 p_2. \\end{align}\\] 8.2 Multivariate normal random variables Exercise 8.3 (Cholesky decomposition) Let \\(X\\) be a random vector of length \\(k\\) with \\(X_i \\sim \\text{N}(0, 1)\\) and \\(LL^*\\) the Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix \\(A\\).

Let \\(X = \\sqrt{U}\\) and \\(Y = V - \\sqrt{U}\\). Find PDF of \\((X,Y)\\). What can you tell about distributions of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)? This exercise shows how we can simplify a probabilistic problem with a clever use of transformations. R: Take 1000 samples from \\((X,Y)\\) and transform them with inverses of the above functions to get samples from \\((U,V)\\). Plot both sets of samples. Solution. First we need to find the inverse functions. Since \\(x = \\sqrt{u}\\) it follows that \\(u = x^2\\), and that \\(x \\in [0,2]\\). Similarly \\(v = y + x\\) and \\(y \\in [0,1]\\). Let us first find the Jacobian. \\[\\renewcommand\\arraystretch{1.6} J(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\\\%[1ex] % &lt;-- 1ex more space between rows of matrix \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x &amp; 1 \\\\%[1ex] % &lt;-- 1ex more space between rows of matrix 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\] and the determinant is \\(|J(x,y)| = 2x\\). Putting everything together, we get \\[\\begin{align} p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_{U,V}(x^2, y + x) |J(x,y)| = \\frac{1}{4 \\sqrt{x^2}} 2x = \\frac{1}{2}. \\end{align}\\] This reminds us of the Uniform distribution. Indeed we can see that \\(p_X(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(p_Y(y) = 1\\). So instead of dealing with an awkward PDF of \\((U,V)\\) and the corresponding dynamic bounds, we are now looking at two independent Uniform random variables. In practice, this could make modeling much easier. set.seed(1) nsamps &lt;- 2000 x &lt;- runif(nsamps, min = 0, max = 2) y &lt;- runif(nsamps) orig &lt;- tibble(x = x, y = y, vrs = &quot;original&quot;) u &lt;- x^2 v &lt;- y + x transf &lt;- tibble(x = u, y = v, vrs = &quot;transformed&quot;) df &lt;- bind_rows(orig, transf) ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vrs)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) Exercise 8.7 R: Write a function that will calculate the probability density of an arbitraty multivariate normal distribution, based on independent standardized normal PDFs.

Follows directly from the CLT. Exercise 13.3 (Consistent but biased estimator) Show that sample variance (the plug-in estimator of variance) is a biased estimator of variance. Show that sample variance is a consistent estimator of variance. Show that the estimator with (\\(N-1\\)) (Bessel correction) is unbiased. Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} E[\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2] &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n E[(Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n E[Y_i^2] - 2 E[Y_i \\bar{Y}] + \\bar{Y}^2)] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n E[Y_i^2 - 2 Y_i \\bar{Y} + \\bar{Y}^2] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n E[Y_i^2 - \\frac{2}{n} Y_i^2 - \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i \\neq j} Y_i Y_j + \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_j \\sum_{k \\neq j} Y_j Y_k + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_j Y_j^2] \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{n - 2}{n} (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) - \\frac{2}{n} (n - 1) \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2}n(n-1)\\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2}n(\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{n-1}{n}\\sigma^2 \\\\ &lt; \\sigma^2. \\end{align*}\\] Let \\(S_n\\) denote the sample variance. Then we can write it as \\[\\begin{align*} S_n &amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\mu)^2 + 2(X_i - \\mu)(\\mu - \\bar{X}) + (\\mu - \\bar{X})^2. \\end{align*}\\] Now \\(\\bar{X}\\) converges in probability (by WLLN) to \\(\\mu\\) therefore the right terms converge in probability to zero. The left term converges in probability to \\(\\sigma^2\\), also by WLLN. Therefore the sample variance is a consistent estimatior of the variance. The denominator changes in the second-to-last line of a., therefore the last line is now equality. Exercise 13.4 (Estimating the median) Show that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the median for N\\((\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). Show that the sample median is an unbiased estimator of the mean for any distribution with symmetric density. Hint 1: The pdf of an order statistic is \\(f_{X_{(k)}}(x) = \\frac{n!}{(n - k)!(k - 1)!}f_X(x)\\Big(F_X(x)^{k-1} (1 - F_X(x)^{n - k}) \\Big)\\). Hint 2: A distribution is symmetric when \\(X\\) and \\(2a - X\\) have the same distribution for some \\(a\\). Solution. Let \\(Z_i\\), \\(i = 1,...,n\\) be i.i.d. variables with a symmetric distribution and let \\(Z_{k:n}\\) denote the \\(k\\)-th order statistic. We will distinguish two cases, when \\(n\\) is odd and when \\(n\\) is even. Let first \\(n = 2m + 1\\) be odd. Then the sample median is \\(M = Z_{m+1:2m+1}\\). Its PDF is \\[\\begin{align*} f_M(x) = (m+1)\\binom{2m + 1}{m}f_Z(x)\\Big(F_Z(x)^m (1 - F_Z(x)^m) \\Big). \\end{align*}\\] For every symmetric distribution, it holds that \\(F_X(x) = 1 - F(2a - x)\\). Let \\(a = \\mu\\), the population mean. Plugging this into the PDF, we get that \\(f_M(x) = f_M(2\\mu -x)\\). It follows that \\[\\begin{align*} E[M] &amp;= E[2\\mu - M] \\\\ 2E[M] &amp;= 2\\mu \\\\ E[M] &amp;= \\mu. \\end{align*}\\] Now let \\(n = 2m\\) be even. Then the sample median is \\(M = \\frac{Z_{m:2m} + Z_{m+1:2m}}{2}\\). It can be shown, that the joint PDF of these terms is also symmetric. Therefore, similar to the above \\[\\begin{align*} E[M] &amp;= E[\\frac{Z_{m:2m} + Z_{m+1:2m}}{2}] \\\\ &amp;= E[\\frac{2\\mu - M + 2\\mu - M}{2}] \\\\ &amp;= E[2\\mu - M]. \\end{align*}\\] The above also proves point a. as the median and the mean are the same in normal distribution.

That is, say a 95% CI should, in the long run, contain the true value of the parameter 95% of the time. In practice, it is impossible to assess the coverage of our CI method, because we rarely know the true parameter. In simulation, however, we can. Let’s assess the coverage of bootstrap percentile intervals. Pick a univariate distribution with readily available mean and one that you can easily sample from. Draw \\(n = 30\\) random samples from the chosen distribution and use the bootstrap (with large enough m) and percentile CI method to construct 95% CI. Repeat the process many times and count how many times the CI contains the true mean. That is, compute the actual coverage probability (don’t forget to include the standard error of the coverage probability!). What can you observe? Try one or two different distributions.

Compare with results from 13.3. What does that say about the MLE estimator? Solution. The mean is assumed constant, so we have the likelihood \\[\\begin{align} L(\\sigma^2; y) &amp;= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(y_i - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}^n} e^{\\frac{-\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} \\end{align}\\] We need to find the maximum of this function. We first observe that we can replace \\(\\frac{-\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\mu)^2}{2}\\) with a constant \\(c\\), since none of the terms are dependent on \\(\\sigma^2\\). Additionally, the term \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}^n}\\) does not affect the calculation of the maximum. So now we have \\[\\begin{align} L(\\sigma^2; y) &amp;= (\\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}}. \\end{align}\\] Differentiating we get \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{d}{d \\sigma^2} L(\\sigma^2; y) &amp;= (\\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\frac{d}{d \\sigma^2} e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} + e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} \\frac{d}{d \\sigma^2} (\\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} \\\\ &amp;= - (\\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{n}{2}} e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} \\frac{c}{(\\sigma^2)^2} - e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} \\frac{n}{2} (\\sigma^2)^{\\frac{n + 2}{2}} \\\\ &amp;= - (\\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{n + 4}{2}} e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} c - e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} \\frac{n}{2} (\\sigma^2)^{\\frac{n + 2}{2}} \\\\ &amp;= - e^{\\frac{c}{\\sigma^2}} (\\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{n + 4}{2}} \\Big(c + \\frac{n}{2}\\sigma^2 \\Big). \\end{align}\\] To get the maximum, this has to equal to 0, so \\[\\begin{align} c + \\frac{n}{2}\\sigma^2 &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\sigma^2 &amp;= -\\frac{2c}{n} \\\\ \\sigma^2 &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\mu)^2}{n}. \\end{align}\\] The MLE estimator is biased. Exercise 15.2 (Multivariate normal distribution) Derive the maximum likelihood estimate for the mean and covariance matrix of the multivariate normal. Simulate \\(n = 40\\) samples from a bivariate normal distribution (choose non-trivial parameters, that is, mean \\(\\neq 0\\) and covariance \\(\\neq 0\\)). Compute the MLE for the sample. Overlay the data with an ellipse that is determined by the MLE and an ellipse that is determined by the chosen true parameters. Repeat b. several times and observe how the estimates (ellipses) vary around the true value. Hint: For the derivation of MLE, these identities will be helpful: \\(\\frac{\\partial b^T a}{\\partial a} = b\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial a^T A a}{\\partial a} = (A + A^T)a\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial \\text{tr}(BA)}{\\partial A} = B^T\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial \\ln |A|}{\\partial A} = (A^{-1})^T\\), \\(a^T A a = \\text{tr}(a^T A a) = \\text{tr}(a a^T A) = \\text{tr}(Aaa^T)\\).

One of the ways of looking at logistic regression is that it is linear regression but instead of using the linear term as the mean of a normal RV, we use it as the mean of a Bernoulli RV. Of course, the mean of a Bernoulli is bounded on \\([0,1]\\), so, to avoid non-sensical values, we squeeze the linear between 0 and 1 with the inverse logit function inv_logit\\((z) = 1 / 1 + e^{-z}\\). This leads to the following model: \\(y_i | \\beta, x \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\text{inv_logit}(\\beta x))\\). Explicitly write the likelihood function of beta.

This data set serves as a great example of finding the latent structure in the data, as there are certain characteristics of the athletes that make them excel at different events. For example an explosive athlete will do particulary well in sprints and long jumps. Perform PCA (prcomp) on the data set and interpret the first 2 latent dimensions. Hint: Standardize the data first to get meaningful results. Use MLE to estimate the covariance of the standardized multivariate distribution.

Repeat the sampling several times. What do you observe? Discuss what a non-diagonal Fisher matrix implies. Hint: The digamma function is defined as \\(\\psi(x) = \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx} \\Gamma(x)}{\\Gamma(x)}\\). Additionally, you do not need to evaluate \\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\psi(x)\\). To calculate its value in R, use package numDeriv. Solution.

What turned out to be a successful approach was to estimate the maximum from the serial numbers of the small sample of captured or destroyed tanks (describe the statistical model used). What assumptions were made by using the above model? Do you think they are reasonable assumptions in practice? Show that the plug-in estimate for the maximum (i.e. the maximum of the sample) is a biased estimator. Derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the maximum. Check that the following estimator is not biased: \\(\\hat{n} = \\frac{k + 1}{k}m - 1\\). Solution. The data are the serial numbers of the tanks. The parameter is \\(n\\), the total production of the tank. The distribution of the serial numbers is a discrete uniform distribution over all serial numbers. One of the assumptions is that we have i.i.d samples, however in practice this might not be true, as some tanks produced later could be sent to the field later, therefore already in theory we would not be able to recover some values from the population. To find the expected value we first need to find the distribution of \\(m\\). Let us start with the CDF. \\[\\begin{align*} F_m(x) = P(Y_1 &lt; x,...,Y_k &lt; x). \\end{align*}\\] If \\(x &lt; k\\) then \\(F_m(x) = 0\\) and if \\(x \\geq 1\\) then \\(F_m(x) = 1\\). What about between those values. So the probability that the maximum value is less than or equal to \\(m\\) is just the number of possible draws from \\(Y\\) that are all smaller than \\(m\\), divided by all possible draws. This is \\(\\frac{{x}\\choose{k}}{{n}\\choose{k}}\\). The PDF on the suitable bounds is then \\[\\begin{align*} P(m = x) = F_m(x) - F_m(x - 1) = \\frac{\\binom{x}{k} - \\binom{x - 1}{k}}{\\binom{n}{k}} = \\frac{\\binom{x - 1}{k - 1}}{\\binom{n}{k}}. \\end{align*}\\] Now we can calculate the expected value of \\(m\\) using some combinatorial identities. \\[\\begin{align*} E[m] &amp;= \\sum_{i = k}^n i \\frac{{i - 1}\\choose{k - 1}}{{n}\\choose{k}} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i = k}^n i \\frac{\\frac{(i - 1)!}{(k - 1)!(i - k)!}}{{n}\\choose{k}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{k}{\\binom{n}{k}}\\sum_{i = k}^n \\binom{i}{k} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{k}{\\binom{n}{k}} \\binom{n + 1}{k + 1} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{k(n + 1)}{k + 1}. \\end{align*}\\] The bias of this estimator is then \\[\\begin{align*} E[m] - n = \\frac{k(n + 1)}{k + 1} - n = \\frac{k - n}{k + 1}. \\end{align*}\\] The probability that we observed our sample \\(Y = {Y_1, Y_2,...,,Y_k}\\) given \\(n\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{{n}\\choose{k}}\\). We need to find such \\(n^*\\) that this function is maximized. Additionally, we have a constraint that \\(n^* \\geq m = \\max{(Y)}\\). Let us plot this function for \\(m = 10\\) and \\(k = 4\\). library(ggplot2) my_fun &lt;- function (x, m, k) { tmp &lt;- 1 / (choose(x, k)) tmp[x &lt; m] &lt;- 0 return (tmp) } x &lt;- 1:20 y &lt;- my_fun(x, 10, 4) df &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y) ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line() Solution. (continued) We observe that the maximum of this function lies at the maximum value of the sample. Therefore \\(n^* = m\\) and ML estimate equals the plug-in estimate. \\[\\begin{align*} E[\\hat{n}] &amp;= \\frac{k + 1}{k} E[m] - 1 \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{k + 1}{k} \\frac{k(n + 1)}{k + 1} - 1 \\\\ &amp;= n. \\end{align*}\\] "],

Let us look at the US voting data here. Compare the number of voters who voted for Trump or Hillary depending on their income (less or more than 100.000 dollars per year). Manually calculate the chi-squared statistic, compare to the chisq.test in R, and discuss the results. Visualize the test. Solution. Let \\(X_i\\) be binary variables, \\(i = 1,...,n\\). We can then express the test statistic as \\[\\begin{align} \\chi^2 = &amp;\\frac{(O_i - np)^2}{np} + \\frac{(n - O_i - n(1 - p))^2}{n(1 - p)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(O_i - np)^2}{np(1 - p)} \\\\ &amp;= (\\frac{O_i - np}{\\sqrt{np(1 - p)}})^2. \\end{align}\\] When \\(n\\) is large, this distrbution is approximately normal with \\(\\mu = np\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = np(1 - p)\\) (binomial converges in distribution to standard normal).

Derive posterior Below we have some data, which represents number of goals in a football match. Choose sensible prior for this data (draw the gamma density if necessary), justify it. Compute the posterior. Compute an interval such that the probability that the true mean is in there is 95%. What is the probability that the true mean is greater than 2.5? Back to theory: Compute prior predictive and posterior predictive. Discuss why the posterior predictive is overdispersed and not Poisson? Draw a histogram of the prior preditive and posterior predctive for the data from (b). Discuss. Generate 10 and 100 random samples from a Poisson distribution and compare the posteriors with a flat prior, and a prior concentrated away from the truth. x &lt;- c(4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3) Solution. \\[\\begin{align*} p(\\lambda | X) &amp;= \\frac{p(X | \\lambda) p(\\lambda)}{\\int_0^\\infty p(X | \\lambda) p(\\lambda) d\\lambda} \\\\ &amp;\\propto p(X | \\lambda) p(\\lambda) \\\\ &amp;= \\Big(\\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{x_i!} \\lambda^{x_i} e^{-\\lambda}\\Big) \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha - 1} e^{-\\beta \\lambda} \\\\ &amp;\\propto \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\alpha - 1} e^{- \\lambda (n + \\beta)} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] We recognize this as the shape of a gamma distribution, therefore \\[\\begin{align*} \\lambda | X \\sim \\text{gamma}(a + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \\beta + n) \\end{align*}\\] For the prior predictive, we have \\[\\begin{align*} p(x^*) &amp;= \\int_0^\\infty p(x^*, \\lambda) d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^\\infty p(x^* | \\lambda) p(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^*!} \\lambda^{x^*} e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\lambda^{\\alpha - 1} e^{-\\beta \\lambda} d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(x^*)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda^{x^* + \\alpha - 1} e^{-\\lambda (1 + \\beta)} d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(x^*)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\frac{\\Gamma(x^* + \\alpha)}{(1 + \\beta)^{x^* + \\alpha}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(1 + \\beta)^{x^* + \\alpha}}{\\Gamma(x^* + \\alpha)} \\lambda^{x^* + \\alpha - 1} e^{-\\lambda (1 + \\beta)} d\\lambda \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\beta^\\alpha}{\\Gamma(x^*)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} \\frac{\\Gamma(x^* + \\alpha)}{(1 + \\beta)^{x^* + \\alpha}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\Gamma(x^* + \\alpha)}{\\Gamma(x^*)\\Gamma(\\alpha)} (\\frac{\\beta}{1 + \\beta})^\\alpha (\\frac{1}{1 + \\beta})^{x^*}, \\end{align*}\\] which we recognize as the negative binomial distribution with \\(r = \\alpha\\) and \\(p = \\frac{1}{\\beta + 1}\\). For the posterior predictive, the calculation is the same, only now the parameters are \\(r = \\alpha + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\) and \\(p = \\frac{1}{\\beta + n + 1}\\). There are two sources of uncertainty in the predictive distribution. First is the uncertainty about the population. Second is the variability in sampling from the population. When \\(n\\) is large, the latter is going to be very small. But when \\(n\\) is small, the latter is going to be higher, resulting in an overdispersed predictive distribution. x &lt;- c(3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3) # b # quick visual check of the prior ggplot(data = data.frame(x = seq(0, 5, by = 0.01)), aes(x = x)) + stat_function(fun = dgamma, args = list(shape = 1, rate = 1)) palpha &lt;- 1 pbeta &lt;- 1 alpha_post &lt;- palpha + sum(x) beta_post &lt;- pbeta + length(x) ggplot(data = data.frame(x = seq(0, 5, by = 0.01)), aes(x = x)) + stat_function(fun = dgamma, args = list(shape = alpha_post, rate = beta_post)) # probability of being higher than 2.5 1 - pgamma(2.5, alpha_post, beta_post) ## [1] 0.2267148 # interval qgamma(c(0.025, 0.975), alpha_post, beta_post) ## [1] 1.397932 3.137390 # d prior_pred &lt;- rnbinom(1000, size = palpha, prob = 1 - 1 / (pbeta + 1)) post_pred &lt;- rnbinom(1000, size = palpha + sum(x), prob = 1 - 1 / (pbeta + 10 + 1)) df &lt;- data.frame(prior = prior_pred, posterior = post_pred) df &lt;- gather(df) ggplot(df, aes(x = value, fill = key)) + geom_histogram(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) # e set.seed(1) x1 &lt;- rpois(10, 2.5) x2 &lt;- rpois(100, 2.5) alpha_flat &lt;- 1 beta_flat &lt;- 0.1 alpha_conc &lt;- 50 beta_conc &lt;- 10 n &lt;- 10000 df_flat &lt;- data.frame(x1 = rgamma(n, alpha_flat + sum(x1), beta_flat + 10), x2 = rgamma(n, alpha_flat + sum(x2), beta_flat + 100), type = &quot;flat&quot;) df_flat &lt;- tidyr::gather(df_flat, key = &quot;key&quot;, value = &quot;value&quot;, - type) df_conc &lt;- data.frame(x1 = rgamma(n, alpha_conc + sum(x1), beta_conc + 10), x2 = rgamma(n, alpha_conc + sum(x2), beta_conc + 100), type = &quot;conc&quot;) df_conc &lt;- tidyr::gather(df_conc, key = &quot;key&quot;, value = &quot;value&quot;, - type) df &lt;- rbind(df_flat, df_conc) ggplot(data = df, aes(x = value, color = type)) + facet_wrap(~ key) + geom_density() 17.2 Posterior sampling Exercise 17.2 (Bayesian logistic regression) In Chapter 15 we implemented a MLE for a logistic regression (see the code below). For this model, conjugate priors do not exist, which complicated the calculation of the posterior. However, we can use sampling from the numerator of the posterior, using rejection sampling. Set a sensible prior distribution on \\(\\beta\\) and use rejection sampling to find the posterior distribution. In a) you will get a distribution of parameter \\(\\beta\\). Plot the probabilities (as in exercise 15.3) for each sample of \\(\\beta\\) and compare to the truth. Hint: We can use rejection sampling even for functions which are not PDFs – they do not have to sum/integrate to 1. We just need to use a suitable envelope that we know how to sample from. For example, here we could use a uniform distribution and scale it suitably. set.seed(1) inv_log &lt;- function (z) { return (1 / (1 + exp(-z))) } x &lt;- rnorm(100) y &lt;- x y &lt;- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = inv_log(1.2 * x)) l_logistic &lt;- function (beta, X, y) { logl &lt;- -sum(y * log(inv_log(as.vector(beta %*% X))) + (1 - y) * log((1 - inv_log(as.vector(beta %*% X))))) return(logl) } my_optim &lt;- optim(par = 0.5, fn = l_logistic, method = &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;, lower = 0, upper = 10, X = x, y = y) my_optim$par # Let&#39;s say we believe that the mean of beta is 0.5.

["A1.html", "A R programming language A.1 Basic characteristics A.2 Why R? A.3 Setting up A.4 R basics A.5 Functions A.6 Other tips A.7 Further reading and references", " A R programming language A.1 Basic characteristics R is free software for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used by statisticians, scientists, and other professionals for software development and data analysis. It is an interpreted language and therefore the programs do not need compilation. A.2 Why R? R is one of the main two languages used for statistics and machine learning (the other being Python). Pros Libraries. Comprehensive collection of statistical and machine learning packages. Easy to code. Open source. Anyone can access R and develop new methods. Additionally, it is relatively simple to get source code of established methods. Large community. The use of R has been rising for some time, in industry and academia. Therefore a large collection of blogs and tutorials exists, along with people offering help on pages like StackExchange and CrossValidated. Integration with other languages and LaTeX. New methods. Many researchers develop R packages based on their research, therefore new methods are available soon after development. Cons Slow. Programs run slower than in other programming languages, however this can be somewhat ammended by effective coding or integration with other languages. Memory intensive. This can become a problem with large data sets, as they need to be stored in the memory, along with all the information the models produce. Some packages are not as good as they should be, or have poor documentation. Object oriented programming in R can be very confusing and complex. A.3 Setting up https://www.r-project.org/. A.3.1 RStudio RStudio is the most widely used IDE for R. It is free, you can download it from https://rstudio.com/. While console R is sufficient for the requirements of this course, we recommend the students install RStudio for its better user interface. A.3.2 Libraries for data science Listed below are some of the more useful libraries (packages) for data science. Students are also encouraged to find other useful packages. dplyr Efficient data manipulation. Part of the wider package collection called tidyverse. ggplot2 Plotting based on grammar of graphics. stats Several statistical models. rstan Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Very flexible model building. MCMCpack Bayesian inference. rmarkdown, knitr, and bookdown Dynamic reports (for example such as this one). devtools Package development. A.4 R basics A.4.1 Variables and types Important information and tips: no type declaration define variables with &lt;- instead of = (although both work, there is a slight difference, additionally most of the packages use the arrow) for strings use \"\" for comments use # change types with as.type() functions no special type for single character like C++ for example n &lt;- 20 x &lt;- 2.7 m &lt;- n # m gets value 20 my_flag &lt;- TRUE student_name &lt;- &quot;Luka&quot;

In the brackets, we define the parameters the function gets, and in curly brackets we define what the function does. We use return() to return values. sum_first_n_elements &lt;- function (n) { my_sum &lt;- 0 for (i in 1:n) { my_sum &lt;- my_sum + i } return (my_sum) } sum_first_n_elements(10) ## [1] 55 A.6 Other tips Use set.seed(arbitrary_number) at the beginning of a script to set the seed and ensure replication. To dynamically set the working directory in R Studio to the parent folder of a R script use setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path)). To avoid slow R loops use the apply family of functions. See ?apply and ?lapply. To make your data manipulation (and therefore your life) a whole lot easier, use the dplyr package. Use getAnywhere(function_name) to get the source code of any function. Use browser for debugging. See ?browser.
